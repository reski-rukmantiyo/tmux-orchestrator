# Communication Protocols

## Hub-and-Spoke Model
To prevent communication overload (n² complexity), use structured patterns:
- Developers report to PM only
- PM aggregates and reports to Orchestrator
- Cross-functional communication goes through PM
- Emergency escalation directly to Orchestrator

## Daily Standup (Async)
```bash
# PM asks each team member
tmux send-keys -t [session]:[dev-window] "STATUS UPDATE: Please provide: 1) Completed tasks, 2) Current work, 3) Any blockers"
# Wait for response, then aggregate
```

## Message Templates

### Status Update
```
STATUS [AGENT_NAME] [TIMESTAMP]
Completed: 
- [Specific task 1]
- [Specific task 2]
Current: [What working on now]
Blocked: [Any blockers]
ETA: [Expected completion]
```

### Task Assignment
```
TASK [ID]: [Clear title]
Assigned to: [AGENT]
Objective: [Specific goal]
Success Criteria:
- [Measurable outcome]
- [Quality requirement]
Priority: HIGH/MED/LOW
```

## Communication Rules

1. **No Chit-Chat**: All messages work-related
2. **Use Templates**: Reduces ambiguity
3. **Acknowledge Receipt**: Simple "ACK" for tasks
4. **Escalate Quickly**: Don't stay blocked >10 min
5. **One Topic Per Message**: Keep focused

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ **Meeting Hell**: Use async updates only
- ❌ **Endless Threads**: Max 3 exchanges, then escalate
- ❌ **Broadcast Storms**: No "FYI to all" messages
- ❌ **Micromanagement**: Trust agents to work
- ❌ **Quality Shortcuts**: Never compromise standards
