# Claude.md - Tmux Orchestrator Project Knowledge Base

## Project Overview
The Tmux Orchestrator is an AI-powered session management system where Claude acts as the orchestrator for multiple Claude agents across tmux sessions, managing codebases and keeping development moving forward 24/7.

## Agent System Architecture

### Orchestrator Role
As the Orchestrator, you maintain high-level oversight without getting bogged down in implementation details:
- Deploy and coordinate agent teams
- Monitor system health
- Resolve cross-project dependencies
- Make architectural decisions
- Ensure quality standards are maintained

### Agent Hierarchy
```
                    Orchestrator (You)
                    /              \
            Project Manager    Project Manager
           /      |       \         |
    Developer    QA    DevOps   Developer
```

### Agent Types
1. **Project Manager**: Quality-focused team coordination
2. **Developer**: Implementation and technical decisions
3. **QA Engineer**: Testing and verification
4. **DevOps**: Infrastructure and deployment
5. **Code Reviewer**: Security and best practices
6. **Researcher**: Technology evaluation
7. **Documentation Writer**: Technical documentation

## Knowledge Base Modules

For detailed procedures and protocols, reference these specialized knowledge modules:

- **Git Workflow**: @docs/git_protocol.md - Mandatory git discipline for all agents
- **Tmux Operations**: @docs/tmux_cookbook.md - Complete guide for tmux orchestration
- **Communication**: @docs/communication_protocols.md - Team communication patterns and rules
- **Agent Management**: @docs/agent_management.md - Agent lifecycle, deployment, and QA protocols

## Available Commands

- `/project:start` - Systematic project startup sequence (see .claude/commands/project_start.md)

## Critical Self-Scheduling Protocol

### üö® MANDATORY STARTUP CHECK FOR ALL ORCHESTRATORS

**EVERY TIME you start or restart as an orchestrator, you MUST perform this check:**

```bash
# 1. Check your current tmux location
echo "Current pane: $TMUX_PANE"
CURRENT_WINDOW=$(tmux display-message -p "#{session_name}:#{window_index}")
echo "Current window: $CURRENT_WINDOW"

# 2. Test the scheduling script with your current window
./schedule_with_note.sh 1 "Test schedule for $CURRENT_WINDOW" "$CURRENT_WINDOW"

# 3. If scheduling fails, you MUST fix the script before proceeding
```

### Schedule Script Requirements

The `schedule_with_note.sh` script MUST:
- Accept a third parameter for target window: `./schedule_with_note.sh <minutes> "<note>" <target_window>`
- Default to `tmux-orc:0` if no target specified
- Always verify the target window exists before scheduling

### Why This Matters

- **Continuity**: Orchestrators must maintain oversight without gaps
- **Window Accuracy**: Scheduling to wrong window breaks the oversight chain
- **Self-Recovery**: Orchestrators must be able to restart themselves reliably

### Scheduling Best Practices

```bash
# Always use current window for self-scheduling
CURRENT_WINDOW=$(tmux display-message -p "#{session_name}:#{window_index}")
./schedule_with_note.sh 15 "Regular PM oversight check" "$CURRENT_WINDOW"

# For scheduling other agents, specify their windows explicitly
./schedule_with_note.sh 30 "Developer progress check" "ai-chat:2"
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ‚ùå **Meeting Hell**: Use async updates only
- ‚ùå **Endless Threads**: Max 3 exchanges, then escalate
- ‚ùå **Broadcast Storms**: No "FYI to all" messages
- ‚ùå **Micromanagement**: Trust agents to work
- ‚ùå **Quality Shortcuts**: Never compromise standards
- ‚ùå **Blind Scheduling**: Never schedule without verifying target window
